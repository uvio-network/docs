# Claim Lifecycle

#### Proposing a Claim

The first and one of the most fundamental actions on Uvio is to propose a claim. Every proposed claim effectively creates a prediction market for the statement being made. And since proposing a claim is permissionless, creating prediction markets on Uvio is permissionless too.

#### Resolving a Claim

Every proposed claim needs to be resolved eventually. The act of expressing opinions about truth statements and the act of resolving truth statements according to events unfolding in the real world, both are reconciled by the users of the platform and their respective reputation.

#### Staked Reputation

Staking reputation on a claim may be accompanied with a comment. Given any claim, the respective agreeing and disagreeing stakes may be viewed by category in order to understand how either side of the market reasons about the statement being made.

#### Claim Lifecycle

The lifecycle of every claim starts with proposing it in the first place. Actions related to proposed claims may be taken in response to said proposed claims. Those actions may intent to resolve, dispute or nullify proposed claims. Note that resolving, disputing and nullifying any claim may be done by proposing those very reactionary claims themselves. That way any action on Uvio may be a claim to begin with.
