# Use Cases

#### Individual Predictions

The first natural use case on Uvio is to propose claims for predictions that any given user themselves may wish to make. There is no need to have many people bet on those individual prediction markets, because the sole purpose for certain claims may simply be to create a track record of competence for one's own interest.

One example here would be the writer of a blog or newsletter, who wishes to keep track of their own predictions that they may make once in a while. Instead of losing track amidst the writing on a Substack, Uvio allows those content creators to make isolated truth statements that people are able to verify and refer to indefinitely. That way Uvio enables those content creators to gain or lose reputation depending on the actual performance of their individual track records in any given field of competence.

#### External Media

The second natural use case on Uvio may be to proof authors of external media platforms either right or wrong. That way communities may achieve accountability for external actors that may have influence over their respective communities because of the content they produce.&#x20;

One example here would be to proof a podcast guest either right or wrong based on the statements they made on said podcast. Anyone would then be able to propose a claim that shows how said podcast guest is either right or wrong. And with the resolution of that proposed claim a track record of said podcast guest may be established on Uvio to make sure that their respective rightness or wrongness can be referred to indefinitely. This may be especially important if said podcast guest were to hide away their wrongness otherwise, which is the current dominant behaviour on established social media platforms.
