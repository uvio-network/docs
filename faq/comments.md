You can only comment on market resolutions if you have been selected to vote on them.

Everything on Uvio is about having real [skin in the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin\_in\_the\_game\_\(phrase\)). Every single Claim proposed on Uvio goes through different lifecycle phases. Every lifecycle phase represents its own market. And only if you participate in a market, only then you can comment on it. In the case of market resolutions you may or may not be selected to verify events in the real world by what we call the [random truth sampling](claims.md#how-to-resolve-a-claim) process. If you have been selected as a voter, then you can comment on market resolutions. Whether you have been selected or not, as long as you have staked reputation on the resolving Claim, whether that itself is a `propose` or `dispute`, you can always comment on those Claims.
