Reputation is the measurable unit of user competence.

Uvio users are predominantly evaluated based on their gained reputation. On the Uvio platform it is not important how many followers, likes or views a user may generate. What we value on the Uvio platform is how right or wrong users are in making statements and decisions. The degree of rightness and wrongness that Uvio users reach over time is measured in reputation. And by participating on the Uvio platform any user may gain or lose reputation based on their own actions. Additionally, more reputation gained allows any user to have more impact across the Uvio platform since all actions and decisions are reputation weighted.

For instance, a user with a higher amount of reputation may be able to dispute or nullify any claim, whereas a user with a lower amount of reputation would may not be able to do so. Higher reputation users are automatically enabled to participate in higher stakes outcomes on the Uvio platform. And while there is no means to buy excessive amounts of reputation, every user must earn the privilege and trust of the community in order to participate in such higher stakes outcomes.

Reputation can be bought by depositing ETH into a smart contract.

It is important for reputation to be inherently valuable in the real world. Users will only act with care in an adversarial environment if they have something precious to lose.&#x20;

Every user receives an initial minimum amount of reputation to begin with. Every user has to start with the bare minimum, without exceptions. Upon participating in Uvio's prediction markets, reputation may be gained and lost. Therefore reputation can always be bought, in order to maintain a minimum amount of reputation that enables every user to participate in the system.

<summary>How is Reputation used?</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**`oneliner`**</mark>

Reputation is used to express opinions, not to verify truth.

<mark style="color:blue;">**`extended`**</mark>

Anyone can stake any amount of reputation when expressing opinions on proposed claims. But verifying the truth on resolving claims will be done by an equal weighted randomized committee on an incentivized "one user one vote" basis.

Excessive amounts of reputation cannot be used to influence final decision making proportionally to a user's reputation. It is a critical property for the system to maintain that reputation cannot be used to verify the truth. For instance, no rich person should ever be able to swing a vote only because they have a lot of money. The true outcomes of the real world have to be verified by an incentivized random set of users, so that the system can guarantee the highest degree of random truth sampling.
