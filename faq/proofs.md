Proofs are all kinds of assets that show what actually happened in the real world.

Uvio allows any community to resolve trust based issues that are bound to the real world in a permissionless way. For that to work out alright the community requires proofs that can show everyone what the truth actually is. And the truth artefacts providing the shelling point for community consensus are any kind of asset that can be uploaded, linked or verified.&#x20;

Users may upload screenshots, photos and documents to prove their claims. We can also imagine scenarios in which claims may be proven by linking to e.g. Wikipedia articles, Super Bowl statistics or official election results. Further it might be possible to integrate frameworks for Zero Knowledge Proofs in the future, so that claims can be backed up by privacy preserving proof systems.&#x20;

The validity of any provided proof may be challenged on a case by case basis so that one kind of proof may or may not be sufficient to verify any given claim.
