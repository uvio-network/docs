<summary>What is Uvio?</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**`oneliner`**</mark>

Uvio shows you what's real.

<mark style="color:blue;">**`extended`**</mark>

Our north star is to surface who is right and who is honest. And we do that using the powerful mechanics of "prediction markets". We could say Uvio is a social network for prediction markets. On the surface, Uvio is structured like any other social media platform. Users can post content and follow content from other users.&#x20;

The difference on Uvio is that when users post what we call [Claims](faq/claims.md), then they stake their [Reputation](faq/reputation.md) with those claims. Eventually the community resolves claims based on events in the real world. And once claims have been resolved, the staked reputation is transferred from those who were wrong to those who were right. For understanding better how Uvio determines who is right or wrong, please read [How to resolve a Claim](faq/claims.md#how-to-resolve-a-claim).

Also good to know, the term "uvio" is a short version of ultra-violet. The colour purple is Uvio's brand origin, because when you mix red and blue together, then you get the colour purple. In US politics you have a two party system. The democrats are blue and the republicans are red. And somewhere in between those lines we ought to find what's right and real. Somewhere in between red and blue there is purple.

<summary>What is Uvio not good for?</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**`oneliner`**</mark>

Uvio is not good for posting typical social media content.

<mark style="color:blue;">**`extended`**</mark>

Users are not meant to share content on Uvio, that they merely like themselves. That includes all content that is not explicitly representing truth statements, like for instance photos of your most recent vacation, pictures of funny animals, videos of your favourite podcast, shower thoughts you need the world to know, or music from the latest rap album etc.

<summary>Who is Uvio for?</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**`oneliner`**</mark>

Uvio is for people who want to understand how right or wrong they are over time.

<mark style="color:blue;">**`extended`**</mark>

Uvio is designed to be an accountability platform. Accountability is critical for society to come to a common understanding so that we can all move forward together. Uvio can be used to create track records for yourself and for others. Therefore two main use cases, other than gambling, are most relevant for us.&#x20;

1. Anyone who wants to keep track of how right or wrong **they themselves** are over time can use Uvio to gauge **their own** reputation within a certain field of expertise.
2. Anyone who wants to keep track of how right or wrong **external actors** are over time can use Uvio to gauge the reputation of **other people** within a certain field of expertise.

The following is an incomplete list of personas that might want to use Uvio for their own reputation, or for the reputation of others.

* **Economists** may use Uvio to make predictions about the **economy**.
* **Founders** may use Uvio to make predictions about their **startups or industry**.

<summary>How is Uvio different to Polymarket?</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**`oneliner`**</mark>

Where Polymarket is about asking questions, Uvio is about making statements.

<mark style="color:blue;">**`extended`**</mark>

Polymarket is designed to ask questions, which tend to have complex sets of possible answers attached to them. Those complex sets of options imply complex matrices of odds upon which bets can be placed. All of that complexity may be defined as feature on Polymarket.&#x20;

In reality any amount of complexity in asking questions inevitably increases the potential for various forms of MEV. Because of this increased MEV surface area we can point to examples of misunderstandings, mistakes, contention, politics, conflict and centralization when attempting to resolve prediction markets on Polymarket. Further, Polymarket volume might be rather meaningless, given that odds and volume do not seem to correlate at all.

Uvio is designed to make truth statements, which are independently verifiable upon expiry. The result of a truth statement is either true or false. Carefully designing truth statements makes it easy to agree or disagree with, given a certain point of view. And most importantly, Uvio is designed to dispute or nullify any truth statement that cannot be answered with either yes or no eventually. Those kinds of mechanisms set Uvio apart in a way where the reputation gained on the Uvio platform can actually be trusted to a great extend. Because Uvio keeps track of competence and integrity, meaning on Uvio we know who is right, and who is honest.

The creation of prediction markets is decentralized on Uvio, where it is centralized on Polymarket. On Uvio, the users decide which claims to propose, because they are automatically staking their own reputation with the prediction markets they themselves create. And if they are not creating them carefully, their reputation may be taxed for violating the rules of the game.

<summary>Can Uvio be a profitable business?</summary>

<mark style="color:green;">**`oneliner`**</mark>

Yes, because Uvio is designed to benefit from fee based revenue streams.

<mark style="color:blue;">**`extended`**</mark>

Uvio defines a simple action space. This action space is so generic that Uvio's platform usage may scale by orders of magnitude. For instance, Uvio can earn fees from the volume on every market. And further, users may be asked to pay a fee in order to dispute or nullify any given claim. A challenge fee like that may even be useful to deter malicious actors from creating many ill-intended claims, whose sole purpose would otherwise be to extract their own form of MEV.
